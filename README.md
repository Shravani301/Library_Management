# Library_Management
 The library management system is designed to provide speed and wide access to update the information in a global manner i.e., E-LIBRARY. It is all about organizing and managing the library and library-oriented tasks. It also involves maintaining the database of entering new books and record of books that have been retrieved or issued, with their respective dates.<br>
The library management system is to maintain the records of books and various documents which are available under the library room and to maintain the database of the students who will take services of their library. There will be different types of users (admin, user) who will use the system in order to perform processing tasks and administrative tasks. It is a web-based application used to store huge data records for a long period in the database, which can be accessed by administrators from wherever in the world and it can be updated.<br>
Overall, this project is being developed to help the library administration, maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce human efforts. It reduces the complexities and has user friendly operations and designing.
